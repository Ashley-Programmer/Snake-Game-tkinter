## Description

This Snake Game is a modern recreation of the classic arcade game where players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the playing field.

## Features

- Clean, responsive GUI using Tkinter
- Score tracking system
- Game over screen
- Arrow key controls for snake movement
- Random food generation
- Collision detection

## Requirements

- Python3
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installation)

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python3 installed on your system
2. Clone this repository or download the source code
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
   cd snake-game
   ```
3. Run the game
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

## How to Play

1. Start the game by running the script
2. Control the snake using the arrow keys (‚Üê, ‚Üí, ‚Üë, ‚Üì)
3. Eat the food (red dots) to grow the snake and increase your score
4. Avoid colliding with walls or the snake's own body

## Game Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Control snake direction

## Code Structure

The game consists of a single Python file `snake_game.py` containing:

- Two classes:
  - `Snake`: Manages the snake's body, coordinates, and appearance
  - `Food`: Handles random food generation and placement

- Main functions:
  - `next_turn()`: Controls snake movement and eating mechanics
  - `change_direction()`: Handles user input for changing snake direction
  - `check_collisions()`: Detects if the snake has hit a wall or itself
  - `game_over()`: Handles end game state

## Game Logic

The game follows these basic principles:
1. The snake moves continuously in the current direction
2. When the snake eats food, it grows longer and the player's score increases
3. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or itself
4. Arrow keys control the snake's direction

## Customization

You can customize the game by editing these variables at the top of the `snake_game.py` file:

- `GAME_WIDTH`: Width of the game window (default: 700)
- `GAME_HEIGHT`: Height of the game window (default: 550)
- `SPEED`: Speed of the snake (default: 300ms - lower is faster)
- `SPACE_SIZE`: Size of each square in the grid (default: 35)
- `BODY_SIZE`: Initial length of the snake (default: 1)
- `SNAKE_COLOR`: Color of the snake (default: "#00FF00" - green)
- `FOOD_COLOR`: Color of the food (default: "#FF0000" - red)
- `BACKGROUND_COLOR`: Color of the background (default: "black")

## Future Improvements

Here are some potential enhancements you could consider adding:

- Add pause/resume functionality
- Implement a game restart option
- Create a high score system that persists between game sessions
- Add sound effects for eating food and game over
- Create a start menu screen
- Add difficulty levels (slower/faster snake speed)
- Implement different types of food with special effects
- Add obstacles or walls in the playing field
